Explanations:
- Linear regression models the relationship between features and exam score as a straight line.
- Polynomial regression allows for a curved relationship, which may fit the data better.
- Feature engineering and selection (e.g., motivation, attendance, sleep) can improve model accuracy.
- Ridge and Lasso add regularization to prevent overfitting and select important features.
- Cross-validation provides a robust estimate of model performance.
