# Task 3: Forest Cover Type Classification

This project predicts the type of forest cover based on cartographic and environmental features using multi-class classification models.

## Dataset
- Download the [UCI Covertype dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/covertype) and place `covtype.csv` in this folder. Large datasets are not included in the repo.

## Steps
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing (handle missing values, encode categoricals)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Model Building (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
4. Model Evaluation (confusion matrix, feature importance)
5. Bonus: Handle class imbalance (SMOTE), compare logistic regression vs. decision tree

## How to Run
1. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Download the dataset as above.
3. Run the notebook (`Forest Cover Type Classification.ipynb`) for step-by-step analysis, or run the script (`forest_cover_classification.py`) for a quick result.

## Outputs
- Model performance metrics
- Visualizations (confusion matrix, feature importance)
